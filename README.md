## Profile

I am an ambitious, former market researcher looking for a challenging, friendly and collaborative work environment to progress as a junior developer.

After graduating from University College London with a first class degree in Psychology, I spent almost two years working as a Market Researcher for a youth research agency.

I have recently completed training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to make my dream of becoming a developer a reality.

My immediate goal is to secure a position at a company where I can continue to grow and improve myself both personally and professionally. I enjoy challenges and look forward to opportunities where I will be able to assume more responsibilities.

**Tech Skills**: Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
